# Implementation Plan: Tab Card High Brightness Visibility Enhancement

## Overview

This implementation enhances Tab card visibility in the staff dashboard for high brightness conditions by applying light backgrounds with strong border contrast to all card states. The approach prioritizes functional visibility over aesthetic preferences, using border thickness and color intensity for visual hierarchy.

**Critical Change**: Pending order cards will change from dark (red-900/800) to light (amber-50/100) backgrounds to ensure visibility in bright conditions.

## Tasks

## Notes

- **CRITICAL**: Pending card background MUST change from dark to light for brightness visibility
- All property tests (7.1-7.9) are REQUIRED for correctness validation
- Manual testing in actual high brightness conditions is strongly recommended
- Rollback plan: `git revert` to baseline tag if issues arise
- Each task specifies file locations and line number estimates where applicable
- Checkpoints include explicit approval gates to prevent premature progression
