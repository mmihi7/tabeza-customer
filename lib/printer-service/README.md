### Manual Installation (Development/Testing)

If you prefer to run the service manually without installing as a Windows service:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

The service will run in the foreground. Press Ctrl+C to stop.

## Configuration

### During Installation

The installer will prompt you for:
- **Bar ID**: Your Tabeza bar identifier (found in your Tabeza dashboard)
- **API URL**: The Tabeza cloud API endpoint (press Enter for default production URL)

### After Installation

Configuration is stored in `config.json` in the service directory. You can edit this file manually or use the configuration endpoint:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8765/api/configure ^
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" ^
  -d "{\"barId\": \"your-bar-id\", \"apiUrl\": \"https://your-api.com\"}"
```

### Environment Variables

You can also configure via environment variables:
- `TABEZA_BAR_ID` - Your bar identifier
- `TABEZA_API_URL` - Tabeza cloud API URL

## POS System Configuration

Configure your POS system to send print jobs to:

```
http://localhost:8765/api/print-job
```

### Configuration Steps by POS Type

#### Generic Network Printer Setup
1. Add a new network printer in your POS
2. Set printer type to "Network/HTTP Printer"
3. Set URL to `http://localhost:8765/api/print-job`
4. Set method to POST
5. Save and test

#### Webhook-Based POS Systems
1. Go to POS webhook settings
2. Add new webhook for "Receipt Printed" event
3. Set URL to `http://localhost:8765/api/print-job`
4. Set content type to `application/json` or `application/octet-stream`
5. Save and test

### Supported Data Formats

The service accepts:
- ESC/POS thermal printer commands (binary)
- Plain text receipts
- JSON formatted receipt data

## API Endpoints

### GET /api/status

Check if the service is running and get configuration info.

**Example:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8765/api/status
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "running",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "printerName": "Tabeza Receipt Printer",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "barId": "bar-123",
  "driverId": "driver-hostname-1234567890",
  "heartbeat": {
    "enabled": true,
    "interval": 30000,
    "lastSent": "2024-01-15T10:29:45Z",
    "failures": 0
  }
}
```

### Heartbeat System

The service automatically sends heartbeat signals to the Tabeza cloud every 30 seconds to maintain connection status. This allows the staff app to display real-time printer connectivity.

**How it works:**
- Heartbeat starts automatically when service starts
- Sends status update every 30 seconds
- Includes driver ID, version, and system metadata
- Retries up to 3 times on failure with exponential backoff
- Continues running even if cloud is temporarily unreachable

**Heartbeat logs:**
```
💓 Starting heartbeat service...
✅ Heartbeat connection restored
❌ Heartbeat failed (attempt 1/3): <error>
   Retrying in 5s...
💔 Heartbeat service stopped
```

**Troubleshooting heartbeat:**
- If heartbeat fails, check your internet connection
- Verify the API URL is correct in config.json
- Check firewall isn't blocking outbound HTTPS
- Service continues to work even if heartbeat fails
- Heartbeat will automatically resume when connection restored

### POST /api/test-print

Send a test print job to verify the service is working.

**Example:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8765/api/test-print ^
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" ^
  -d "{\"barId\": \"bar-123\", \"testMessage\": \"Test print\"}"
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "jobId": "test-1234567890",
  "message": "Test print sent successfully"
}
```

### POST /api/configure

Update service configuration.

**Example:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8765/api/configure ^
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" ^
  -d "{\"barId\": \"bar-123\", \"apiUrl\": \"https://your-api.com\"}"
```

**Response:**
```json

## Troubleshooting

### Service won't start

**Symptoms:** Service fails to start or immediately stops

**Solutions:**
1. Check if port 8765 is already in use:
   ```bash
   netstat -ano | findstr :8765
   ```
2. Verify Node.js is installed:
   ```bash
   node --version
   ```
3. Check Windows Event Viewer:
   - Open Event Viewer
   - Go to Windows Logs > Application
   - Look for errors from "Tabeza Printer Service"
4. Try running manually to see errors:
   ```bash
   cd "C:\Program Files\Tabeza\printer-service"
   npm start
   ```

### Print jobs not being captured

**Symptoms:** POS prints but nothing appears in Tabeza

**Solutions:**
1. Verify POS is configured to send to `http://localhost:8765/api/print-job`
2. Check service is running:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8765/api/status
   ```
3. Test with the test endpoint:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```
4. Check firewall settings:
   - Open Windows Defender Firewall
   - Allow Node.js through firewall
   - Allow port 8765 inbound connections
5. Check service logs in installation directory

### Can't connect to Tabeza cloud

**Symptoms:** Service runs but receipts don't appear in dashboard

**Solutions:**
1. Check your internet connection
2. Verify the API URL in config.json:
   ```bash
   type config.json
   ```
3. Verify your Bar ID is correct (check Tabeza dashboard)
4. Test cloud connectivity:
   ```bash
   curl https://your-tabeza-url.vercel.app/api/printer/relay
   ```
5. Check for proxy/firewall blocking outbound HTTPS

### Heartbeat failures

**Symptoms:** Staff app shows "Disconnected" even though service is running

**Solutions:**
1. Check service logs for heartbeat errors:
   ```
   ❌ Heartbeat failed (attempt 1/3): <error>
   ```
2. Verify internet connection is stable
3. Check firewall allows outbound HTTPS to Tabeza cloud
4. Verify API URL in config.json is correct
5. Test heartbeat endpoint manually:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://your-tabeza-url.vercel.app/api/printer/heartbeat ^
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" ^
     -d "{\"barId\":\"your-bar-id\",\"driverId\":\"your-driver-id\",\"version\":\"1.0.0\",\"status\":\"online\"}"
   ```
6. If heartbeat continues to fail, service will still process print jobs
7. Heartbeat will automatically resume when connection is restored

**Note:** The service can process print jobs even if heartbeat is failing. Heartbeat only affects the connection status display in the staff app.

### Port 8765 already in use

**Symptoms:** Error "EADDRINUSE" when starting

**Solutions:**
1. Find what's using the port:
   ```bash
   netstat -ano | findstr :8765
   ```
2. Kill the process (replace PID with actual process ID):
   ```bash
   taskkill /PID <PID> /F
   ```
3. Or change the port in index.js (line 11):
   ```javascript
   const PORT = 8766; // Change to different port
   ```
