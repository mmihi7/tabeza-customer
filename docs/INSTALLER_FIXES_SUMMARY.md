# TabezaConnect Installer Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Terms & Privacy Checkbox Issue ✅

**Problem**: 
- Custom terms page with checkbox was not working properly
- Checkbox was visible immediately without requiring scroll
- Terms linked to wrong product (Tabeza app instead of TabezaConnect)

**Solution**:
- Created comprehensive `TERMS_AND_PRIVACY.txt` document specific to POS printer functionality
- Switched to Inno Setup's built-in license page (`LicenseFile` directive)
- Built-in license page automatically:
  - Requires user to scroll to bottom before "I accept" button enables
  - Shows proper "I accept the agreement" radio button
  - Blocks installation until accepted
  - Provides better UX than custom implementation

**Files Changed**:
- Created: `TabezaConnect/src/installer/TERMS_AND_PRIVACY.txt`
- Modified: `TabezaConnect/installer.iss` (removed custom terms page code)

### 2. Terms & Privacy Content ✅

**Created comprehensive document covering**:
- Service description (print spooler monitoring, non-blocking operation)
- Data collection and privacy (what we collect, what we don't, how we use it)
- User responsibilities and prohibited uses
- Printer and POS compatibility disclaimers
- Limitation of liability for printing issues
- Service availability and local queue
- Termination and data deletion
- Compliance with laws (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)
- Contact information for support and privacy inquiries

**Key Legal Protections**:
- Clear disclaimer that we don't interfere with printing
- No liability for POS or printer issues
- Data retention and deletion policies
- Indemnification clause
- Arbitration and dispute resolution
- Class action waiver

### 3. Antivirus Advisory ✅

**Problem**:
- Users unable to install due to antivirus blocking
- No guidance on how to handle security software warnings

**Solution**:
- Created comprehensive installation advisory document
- Includes step-by-step instructions for major antivirus software:
  - Windows Defender
  - Avast
  - Norton
  - McAfee
- Provides both temporary disable and exclusion methods
- Explains why antivirus flags the software (legitimate system operations)
- Includes troubleshooting steps and support contact

**File Created**:
- `Tabz/TABEZACONNECT_INSTALLATION_ADVISORY.md`

**Where to Use**:
- Add to downloads page in staff dashboard
- Include in installation email
- Link from support documentation
- Display during onboarding flow

## Installation Flow (Updated)

1. **Welcome Screen** - Introduction to Tabeza POS Connect
2. **License Agreement** - Terms & Privacy (scroll to bottom to enable "I accept")
3. **Bar ID Input** - Enter venue identifier with validation
4. **Installation** - Files copied, service registered
